the diamond problem, that's why C# doesn't allow multiple inheritance. 


How does C# use interface?

An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a class or a struct can implement. 
Guarantee that a given set of methods will be implemented; it avoids cornering itself on how code will be implemented. 


How do interfaces help avoid the diamond problem?

C# makes it not a problem as all a class needs to do is provide an implementation for the method so that the code 
can be written to call that method.
